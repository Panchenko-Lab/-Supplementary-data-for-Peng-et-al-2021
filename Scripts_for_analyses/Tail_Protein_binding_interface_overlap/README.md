# scripts for calculating DNA binding interface overlap ratio between histone tails and binding proteins

## BP_DNA_contacts.tcl
Custom TCL scripts for calculating partner-DNA contacts number per DNA basepair in PDB surtcures using VMD

To execute the scripts:

vmd -e BP_DNA_contacts.tcl

## Tail_protein_interface_overlap.py

Custom pthyon script for calculating DNA binding interface overlap ratio between histone tails and binding proteins

## BP_dna_contacts.R, binding_interface_overlap_density_plot.R

Sample R scripts for making plots
 
## Required programs

* VMD
* R
* Python3

## Example outputs

Some example output files are provided at [Raw_Data/Tail_DNA_binding_interface_overlap](https://github.com/yunhuip/Supplementary-data-for-Peng-et-al-2021/tree/main/Raw_Data/Tail_DNA_binding_interface_overlap)
